        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My husband LOVES these potatoes. The potatoes are baked and then scooped out.
         Mix potatoes with shredded cheddar and the 'secret' zing-sour cream and onion dip.
         Goes great with a grilled steak!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large baking potatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) container sour cream and onion dip</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Bake potatoes in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Slice tops off of potatoes and scoop the flesh into a large bowl, leaving skins intact.</li>
